#How to install
1. Install Vim for windows here: http://www.vim.org/download.php
2. Download the file "InstallPetersVimSettings.bat" and run it from cmd as administrator.

The install script will only work if you installed Vim at the default location "C:\Program Files (x86)\Vim".
Perform a find and replace in the file "InstallPetersVimSettings.bat" on that path if vim is installed at aothher path.
